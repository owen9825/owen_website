[This demonstration](https://github.com/owen9825/jupyter_demo) of Jupyter is aimed especially at business / finance people who think of software engineers as code monkeys. I feel that any job can be improved by some programming knowledge; and this notebook represents a scenario that many might imagine to be too far removed from those possibilities.

I still need to write more about it on Quora to spread the word and change the world, but one such post is [I want to start learning how to code. Where should I start? What do I need?](https://qr.ae/TWvMiK).
