# Personal Website
* I'll use Jekyll, since I like its decoupling of things and its easy way of including extra pages. Also, I like how [Tanuki](https://tanuki.ai) turned out.
## Installation
* [Install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
* Get [Ruby Virtual Environment](https://rvm.io/)
* Change the shell to the Ruby shell, which allows logging in.
* [Install the Gems](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/): ```bundle install```

## Running
```bash
bundle exec jekyll build
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
## Future
* Animating face upon hover
* Gif for face
